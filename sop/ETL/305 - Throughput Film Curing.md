## Abstract

This SOP covers the process for curing the adhesive films used in ETL throughput mockups.

## Required Materials


| PLACEHOLDER |
|:------------------------:|
|Fig 1. Required materials |

  - 1x Assembly plate with mockups chips placed
  - 1x Weight Applier for Modules (WAM) fixture
  - 1x Vacuum oven
  - 2x Silicon oven mitts

### Step 1: *Preheat oven*

Preheat the oven to 70C with the WAM inside so it can also get up to temperature. Be sure that the vent is open to avoid a build-up of pressure inside the oven. At this point also make sure that the vacuum port is closed.

### Step 2: *Insert assembly Plate*

First, using the oven mitts, remove the WAM from the oven and place it on a heat-safe surface. Then, ensure that the WAM is in it's open position as shown in figure 2a. Then carefully insert the assembly plate into the WAM, making sure to avoid any jerky movement that could disturb the as-yet unadhered chips from their correct positions. After the plate has been fully inserted into the WAM, use the lever to close it as shown in figure 2b. Finally, use the oven mitts to transfer the WAM+plate back into the oven and close the door.

### Step 3: *Cure Step 1*

After the plate is in the oven, wait **15 minutes** for the whole assembly to get up to temperature.

### Step 4: *Apply Vacuum*

Now, close the vent of the oven and turn on the vacuum pump. Slowly open the vacuum port on the oven until you observe the pressure reading dropping. After the pressure is below 10 in-Hg, open the vacuum port the rest of the way and keep it open until the pressure hits 26 in-Hg. Then, close the vacuum port and turn off the vacuum pump.

### Step 5: *Cure Step 2*

With vacuum applied, wait an additional **15 minutes** for the cure to finalize.

### Step 6: *Relieve vacuum and remove from oven*

Release the vacuum by opening up the vent port all of the way unil the pressure reading returns to neutral. Open the oven and use the oven mitts to remove the WAM+plate and place it, again, on a heat-safe surface. Use the lever to open the WAM and remove the plate. Place the plate somewhere to cool and replace the WAM back in the vacuum oven. If not continuing to cure another plate, turn off the oven at this point.

### Step 7: *Logging and Cleanup*

After the plate has cooled (~5 minutes), place it in the "ETL TO BE BONDED" drawer in the dry air cabinet. Note the module IDs on the plate and put the current date for each of the modules in the "Film Cured" column.
