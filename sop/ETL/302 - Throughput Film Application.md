# ETL:302 - Throughput Film Application

Author: Caleb Fangmeier

Last Edited: July 21, 2023

## Abstract

This SOP covers the application of adhesive films for ETL module assembly. More specifically, it provides details on applying the sensor-mount film to the Module PCB as well as the baseplate film to the baseplate. The photographs demonstrating the procedure will show the "throughput" module components, but the procedure is very similar for production components and differences between the two will be spelled out when needed.

## Required Materials

|Fig 1. Required materials |

*For applying the sensor mount film to the Module PCB*

  - 1x Clamshell jig with bottom stencil "MP V3" and top stencil "SM V3"
  - 1x Module PCB
  - 1x Sensor Mount Film
  - 1x small spatula
  - 1x Vacuum pump split into two lines with a valve on each line. The two lines plug into the clamshell jig
  - 1x Grounded copper braid (optional, but strongly recommended)

*For applying the baseplate film to the Baseplate*

  - 1x Clamshell jig with bottom stencil "MP V3" and top stencil "BP V3"
  - 1x Baseplate
  - 1x Baseplate film
  - 1x small spatula
  - 1x Vacuum pump split into two lines with a valve on each line. The two lines plug into the clamshell jig
  - 1x Grounded copper braid (optional, but strongly recommended)


### Step 1: *Stage Components on Jig*

  - Turn on Vacuum Pump
  - Close both valves on vacuum lines
  - Place Module PCB or baseplate as shown in Figs 2a and 2b. Open valve to supply suction to the base of the clamshell jig.
  - Place film as shown in Figs 2a or 2b. Open valve to supply suction the the top of the clamshell jig

### Step 2: *Remove Liner & Mitigate static charge*

  - Remove the exposed liner from the film starting with the tab. Use a thin spatula to help remove the liner without overly bending or moving the film
  - (Optional) Brush the grounded copper braid over the film. This helps remove static charge induced by peeling off the liner which can tend to make the film stick to the top of the clamshell jig.

### Step 3: *Apply Film*

  - Close the Jig and press the top firmly down.
  - Close the valve supplying vacuum to the top of the jig.
  - Wait for at least 1 minute for the film to bond to the bottom piece.
  - Slowly open the jig
  - Turn off the bottom vacuum.
  - Press firmly with your fingers to make sure the film is stuck down.
  - Remove the baseplate or Module PCB from the jig. Store in dry air cabinet until needed.
