# ETL:303 - Film Jig Setup

Author: Caleb Fangmeier

Last Edited: July 14, 2023

## Abstract

This SOP covers the procedure for installing or replacing the alignment stencils in the film application Jigs.


## Required Materials

  - 2x Clamshell Jigs
  - 2x base stencils, labeled "MP V3"
  - 1x top stencil, labeled "BP V3"
  - 1x top stencil, labeled "SM V3"
  - 2x 1/4" alignment pins
  - 1x 3/32" hex wrench

A basic setup uses two clamshell jigs, one with the appropriate alignment stencils for the sensor mount film and another for the baseplate film. 
For the sensor mount film, the appropriate top stencil is "SM V3" and the bottom stencil is "MP V3". 
For the baseplate film, the appropriate top stencil is "BP V3" and the bottom stencil is, again, "MP V3".

## Procedure

### Step 0: Prepare stencils

The stencils are fabricated with a laser-cutting process which sometimes leaves burrs on the bottom side along some of the cuts. To remove these, just rub the bottom side of the stencil on some fine grit (eg. 2500) sandpaper until you can no longer feel any burrs.
After sanding be sure to wash the stencils in soapy water to remove any residual grit or oils.

### Step 1: (if installed) Remove top stencil

 Use a 3/32" hex wrench to remove the six screws in the top of the jig as shown in Fig. 2. After all of the screws are removed, open the jig and take out the top stencil and clamps. Retain the clamps and screws for future use.

### Step 2: Install new top stencil

To install the new top stencil, hold it against the top part of the clamshell jig as shown in figure 3a. 
Note that for all the stencils, the correct placement and orientation lines up the two 1/4" holes in the stencil with those in the jig, and has the inscribed text legible (ie not flipped).
Next, insert one of the screws into the top and thread it part way into the clamp. 
Insert the other two screws into the clamp. Repeat the process for the 2nd clamp.
Make sure not to tighten the clamps at this point so that the stencil can still slide freely. The final assembly is shown in figure 3b.

### Step 3: (if installed) remove bottom stencil

The bottom stencil can be removed in the same manner as the top stencil. See Step 1 for details.

### Step 4: Install new bottom stencil

The bottom stencil is installed in the same manner as the top stencil. See Step 2 for details. Again, ensure that the clamps are not tightened down and the stencil can slide freely at this point.

### Step 5: Insert pins and align stencils

Manually align the stencils so that the 1/4" holes on both line up with the matching holes on the jig. Then carefully close the jig while attempting to keep the stencils in place. 
With the jig closed, firmly press the alignment pins into the jig. 
With the pins installed, now use the hex wrench to tighten up the clamps for both the top and bottom stencils.
Finally, remove the pins. Do not try to pull the pins back up the direction they were inserted because they will tend to bind on the stencils.
Instead press them the rest of the way through and out the bottom of the jig. You may need to use a pair of plyers to pull them out.
After the pins are removed, the process is complete and the jigs are ready for use.
See SOP ETL/302 for details on use.
