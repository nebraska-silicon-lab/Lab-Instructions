To upload firmwar to the KCU105, first add this command to your .bashrc

get_firmware_zip() {
    version=$1
    project="etl_test_fw"
    projectid="107856"

    file=$project-$version.zip
    url=$(curl  "https://gitlab.cern.ch/api/v4/projects/${projectid}/releases/$version" | jq '.description' | sed -n "s|.*\[$project.zip\](\(.*\)).*|\1|p")
    wget $url
    unzip $file
}

Either close and reopen the terminal, or run ```source .bashrc``` from your home directory.

You may need to install ```curl``` and ```jq``` for the script to work.
Run the scrip with the version of firmware you want to use

get_firmware_zip v2.1.2

Move to the directory that has been created, somehting like ```etl_test_fw-v2.1.2```
With the board connected and powered on, ```source program.sh``` will load the firmware to the board. The self test LEDs should now either start "breathing" or "cyloning" to indicate the firmware is loaded.

The board is now ready to use with test software.
