To use the module test software,  several dependencies are needed.

If using a RHEL based version of linux, install 'ipbus for uhal' with

sudo yum install cactuscore-uhal-python3

If on a Debian/Ubuntu based version of linux, you can attempt to compile from source following these instructions:

I encountered issues with this method and chose to use the docker container preped by BU.

This can be downloaded and installed with the command:

docker run -it --name tamalero danbarto/centos-uhal-py3:latest /bin/bash

which will pull the latest version of the container, then start it up. All work with the test software must be done inside the container. 

With the container running, clone the git repo with the module test software

git clone https://gitlab.cern.ch/cms-etl-electronics/module_test_sw.git
