## Abstract
   This SOP covers the procedure for the encapsulation.
   
## Required Materials

  ### Instruments for the Encapsulation
  
   - Nordson EFD 3-Axis EV Series Automated Fluid Dispensing Robot
   - Nordson EFD's Ultimus I dispensers
   - Height Sensor 
   - Optimum Syringe Barrel (5cc), Syringe Barrel Adapters, Piston and Tip Caps 
   - Nordson EFD Precison Tips: 23GA (Orrange) 30GA (Pink) 32GA (Yellow)
   - Centrifuge Machine
  
  ### Materials to Prepare the Encapsulant
  
   - Sylgard 186 Silicon Elastomer Kit (Base & Curing Agent)
   - Nordson EFD 2K 50ml Manual Cartidges Dispenser Gun, 10:1 ratio
   - Nordson EFD 2-Part Cartidegs with Sealing Cap, 10:1 ratio
   - Nordson EFD 2K, 10:1 S & L 50ML Pistons
   - Disposable Spiral Mixer and 1cc, 5cc & 10cc Syringe

## Required Software

Nordoson Dispense Motion


## Required Training

Users must complete a short training program with either Caleb or another trained person to conduct this activity.

## Procedure

### Encapsulant (Sylgard 186) Mixing Procedure

 1. First, wear the gloves and then place the 2-Part Cartidge barrale on a stand to hold. 
 2.  Using a 1cc syring fill up the thin part of the cartidge by the sylgard curing agent and seal it up by the piston
 3.  Using a 10cc syringe or using an ice-cream stick fill up the thick parth of the cartidge and seal it up by the piston
 4.  Set the cartidge in the dispenser gun                                                                                                              <img src="https://github.com/jhosain/Lab-Instructions/blob/patch-1/sop/ETL/106_materials/images/dispenser_gun.jpeg" width="400px">
 
 

### Encapsulation Procedure

  ### Step 1: Preapring and Moungint the Dispenser Syringe 
  
  Plug the static spiral mixer to the cartidge and the fill up the 5cc syringe barrel by pressing the gun
  Use the centrifuge machine to remove the air bubbles from the dispensing syrige barrel
  Rplace tip cap with a precision dispanse tip from the syringe barrel and attach it to the adapter assembly
  
  ### Step 2: Purging the Dispenser Syring 
  
  ### Step 3: Starting the Program
  
  ### Step 4: Calibrating the Needle Tip 
  
  1. Hit the "Needle Z Detect" button to calibrate the z height. 
  2. Hit the "Needle XY Adjust" button to calibrate the X & Y position. 
  
  ### Step 5: Despensing (Potting)
  
  ### Step 6: Removing Syring from Holder
  
  ### Step 7: Saving and Ending the Program
  
  ### Step 8: Creating and Publishing Report
  
  ### Step 9: Transfering Plates to the Curing Vacuum Oven
  
  ### Step 10: Transfering Modules to the Carrier
  
  ## Results 
  

  - Needle tip size
  - Air Pressure
  - Encapsulant Bead Dimensions (Width, lenght, Height)
  - Tip and Bond Pad Gap
  - Rate of motion of the Syringe ( Flow Rate)
  - Number of Passes
  - Line Dispense Setup
  - Backtrack Setup
  - Z Clearance Setup
  - Timming
  - Curing Time
  - Bead Dimension after Curing
  - Bead Dimension on PCB w/wo wirebonds
  - Bead Dimension on Glass Plate
  - Bead Dimension vs Speed/Air_Pressure/Tip_Gap/Pass_No/Time/Cure_Time/Tip_Size 


  ## Timming
   
  - Mixing sylgard and filling cartidg barrel: 
  - Mixing, filling syringe, degassing (removing air bubbles), mounting syringe on robot 
  - Calibration and pruging time
  - Potting Time
  
  - Useful Pot life from time of mix
  
  - Curing time at room temperuture 
  
  #### Mix, fill syringe, removing bubbles, mount syringe on robot & purge needle ~ 10 mins
  #### Calibration using Needle tip detect, Needle XY adjust ~ 5 mins
  #### Encapsulation timming with two passes using 30GA precsion tip (pink) where pressure is 100 psi and speed is 0.1 mm/s
  - 1 pass ~ 3.5 mins and 2 passes ~ 7 mins on a pad. Total time for four pads is 30 mins
  #### Encapsulant Curing time
  - 8 hrs to 24hrs to cure the sylgard 186 at room temp
  - In a oven it takes 1.5 hrs at 50˚C
