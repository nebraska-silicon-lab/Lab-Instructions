# Lab:110 - Technical Onboarding

Last Updated: July 6, 2023

This SOP consists of a list of resources that contain information helpful for getting up to speed with the technical aspects of work in the Detector Lab. It is broken down into three parts: Information helpful for working with the equipment in the lab, information on the CMS detector, and resources for the specific subdetectors that the detector lab is working on.

## Working in the Lab

  - The [lablog](nebraskadetectorlab.com) is an important resource for working in the lab. It primarily offers a message board-like interface for documenting work and reporting issues. It also has sections for creating requisitions for needed purchases and a listing of equipment in the lab that includes links to datasheets and manuals.
  - We operate a test stand for QA of the TFPX modules that are produced in the lab. Instructions on how to operate the test stand are available [here](). TODO: Find resource
  - In the cleanroom we use a robotic gantry for module assembly. In-person training is required to operate the gantry, but the resources [here](https://github.com/CUASAS/pixel-gantry-control) and [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jjhutLgPGgwVizSZdoIk1yHqYb2zJ_WL) are good to review prior to training.
