# Lab:190 - COVID-19 Procedures

Last Updated: Sept. 28, 2021

### **All lab workers must acknowledge that they have read and understand this SOP by filling out the form [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeE4SkGVjgMc4MU5w8YfJallbkk7M9qL2hIbUzYeaktcB2k8Q/viewform?usp=sf_link)**

  - First and foremost, workers in the Detector Lab must comply with current university guidance with respect to COVID-19 protocols. Further information on this can be found [here](https://covid19.unl.edu/fall-2021-campus).

  - Do not come to the lab if the work you plan can be done from home
 
  - Face masks must be worn at all times in the lab. There are disposable masks provided in the lab, but personal cloth or disposable masks are also acceptable.

  - Practice social distancing if you are not alone in the lab

  - After you are done with your work, use a disinfectant spray with wipes to clean the surfaces you touched including the bench top, tools, keyboard, your custom-made equipment, your chair. Wiping the door handles and light switches is good too. You can also do a similar procedure when you come in. The spray/supplies will be provided.

  - When you come into the lab, wash hands with a disinfecting soap that will be provided next to the sink. Do it also if you stepped out of the lab for whatever reason and coming back.

  - Wear disposable thin gloves, especially for the work in the clean room, but also in the general area if you can (the gloves are available). Do not reuse them. When wearing them, do not touch your face or other exposed body parts (and same advice stands without the gloves, of course).

  - If you feel you are even slightly sick, whether your symptoms match COVID-19 or not, just do not come to the lab. If there is urgent work to do, discuss with your faculty supervisor first (prof. Golf or Kravchenko).

  - If you notice the supply of any PPE is low, inform your supervisor who will then have replacements ordered.
