## **Clean room instructions**

This document serves to establish guidelines and procedures for the
proper utilization, maintenance, and operation of the clean room to
ensure a controlled environment with minimal contamination. These
guidelines apply to all personnel who access and work within the clean
room. It covers entry and exit procedures, proper attire, equipment
handling, and environmental controls.

Clean room at HEP lab can be accessed from the gowning room, and these
are maintained at two different air pressures. Clean room is maintained
at over pressure, and gowning room is at lower pressure.

1.  **Entry instructions:**

    a.  Only authorized personnel with UNL access card may enter the
        clean room.

    b.  Check or turn on the vacuum pumps if you want to utilize them in
        the clean room. Vacuum pumps are connected with the gantry and
        the wire bonding machine through the wall pipe and for which the
        control is setup in the general area of the lab.
